Discussion
I used the following technologies: Javascript, HTML, CSS.

In this app the current weather data for cities from all over the world can be requested. The data are delivered by an external API. A loading message is displayed while the request to the external API is in progress. When the weather data are received successfully this message disappears and the data are shown. The background image is chosen depending on the current weather. The website is styled by using flexbox so that it can be viewed on devices with different screen sizes.

Requirements
Browser, internet access
